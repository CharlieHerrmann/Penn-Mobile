This project completes the first 3 steps of the IOS design challenge. 
The UI is directly copied from the zeplin. I parsed data from the API 
into a table view that resembles the penn mobile dining App. Clicking
on a table view cell will lead to the venues website. The majority
of the code is done in the TableViewController. Custom table view
cells were made using a .xib file. WebViewController controls the 
webview.
